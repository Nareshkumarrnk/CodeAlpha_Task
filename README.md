## ✅ TASK 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech
**🎯 Objective:** Recognize human emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) from `.wav` audio recordings.

### 📌 Description:
- Used the RAVDESS dataset of labeled emotional speech clips.
- Extracted Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as input features.

### 🤖 Model:
- CNN model for classification
- Optionally extendable to LSTM/RNN

### 📊 Tools:
`Librosa`, `TensorFlow`, `NumPy`, `Keras`, `Matplotlib`
